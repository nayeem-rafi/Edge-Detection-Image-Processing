# Edge Detection Image Processing
 This MATLAB code processes an image by converting it to grayscale and applying a Sobel filter for edge detection. It calculates vertical and horizontal edges, combines them, normalizes the result to the range of 0-255, and displays the enhanced edge-detected image in grayscale.
